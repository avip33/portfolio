This is a sample post to demonstrate the MDX setup. You can delete this file once you start writing your own content.

## How to Write Posts

Create a new `.mdx` file in the `content/writing` directory with the following frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
date: "2026-01-20"
description: "A brief description for SEO and previews"
published: true
---
```

## MDX Features

You can use all standard Markdown features:

- **Bold text** and *italic text*
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists and numbered lists
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting

### Code Examples

```typescript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

### Custom Components

You can also use React components directly in your MDX files. For example, the `Callout` component:

<Callout type="info">
  This is an info callout. Great for tips and notes.
</Callout>

### Adding More Components

To add more components (like ReactFlow, charts, etc.), edit the `src/lib/mdx.tsx` file and add them to the `components` object.
